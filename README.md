# Suns Explorer 

A playful visualization of serious data.

## About

Suns Explorer is part of a series of projects that explores new and unique ways of viewing the museums’ collections.  

This project demonstrates a simple, algorithmic approach to rendering the color information supplied with the object records in the Harvard Art Museums API. Each artwork is rendered as a group of concentric circles. The colors and behavior are set by the data that describe the work. For example, the time it takes each work to move across the screen is based on the total number of times that object’s page has been viewed on the museums’ public website since 2009—the slower the pace, the more popular the artwork. 

This repository contains two versions of the project.  

* Basic is a non-interactive version created with plain HTML and javascript 
* Advanced is an interactive version written in NodeJS
